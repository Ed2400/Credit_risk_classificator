Model 1 has a precision of 85% for class 1 and a recall of 91%.
Model 2 has a precision of 84% for class 1 and a recall of 99%.

The results were succesful by obtaining a great model for prediction,, ging us nearly a perfect precision o detecting a heatlhy loan and 85% of precision in a risky one
Due to the porpouse of the model, precision take a huge importance, ThatÂ´s why i will recommend the first model to the company.
